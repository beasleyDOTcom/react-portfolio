            <p>I am so glad I've found an industry which prizes teamwork, creative problem solving, and retrospective/iterative planning because I think these are some of my biggest assets.
            Driven by a desire to be helpful, I am an enthusiastic student of Software Development because I believe it is the realm in which I can do the most good for humanity and have the most fun.
